# HR Data Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a comprehensive, interactive Human Resources (HR) Data Analysis Dashboard using **Microsoft Power BI**. The primary goal was to transform raw HR data for a company with 2,845 employees into actionable strategic insights for executive management.

The dashboard focuses on key HR metrics, including employee demographics, engagement scores, training costs, and performance distribution, revealing critical areas for strategic intervention.

## Key Insights & Business Value
The analysis of the dataset revealed several critical findings, which were translated into strategic recommendations:

1.  **Low Engagement:** Despite 86% of employees being active, the average Engagement Score was critically low at 2.94/6, indicating a significant need for engagement initiatives.
2.  **Workforce Aging:** The average employee age was 49, highlighting a need for succession planning and strategies to attract younger talent.
3.  **Departmental Imbalance:** A high concentration of 67% of the workforce (1,910 employees) in the Production department suggested a potential risk and imbalance across divisions.
4.  **Performance Disparity:** Smaller departments (Sales, Software Engineering) showed exceptional performance (92-100% high ratings), while larger departments lagged, suggesting best practices from smaller teams should be scaled.
5.  **Training ROI Question:** A total training cost of $1.59M (approx. $560 per employee) raised questions about the return on investment, as it did not correlate with high engagement scores.

## Technical Stack
*   **Tool:** Microsoft Power BI
*   **Techniques:** Data Cleaning, Data Modeling (Star Schema/Snowflake), DAX Calculations, Interactive Visualizations (Cards, Bar Charts, Maps, Donut Charts).ج
